		<section>A fullstack web application developer interested in providing enterprise class solutions using JavaScript</section>
		<section>It's a bit of a mouthful but I tend to be precise ;)</section>
		<section>So when I say fullstack, I mean I've worked with these: TBD</section>
		<section>However, I'd prefer to work with these: TBD</section>
		<section>And when I said web application developer...</section>
		<section>...it ranges from a fully scalable case management system with complex integrations to external systems including SSO, SOAP Web Services, ReST API integration, etc...</section>
		<section>...to simpler content management systems for serving web pages on a LAMP stack</section>
		<section>Lately, however, I've been working mostly with JavaScript for both back/frontend development...</section>
		<section>...using VIm as my favourite editor...</section>
		<section>...and I've been actively maintaining a web API platform as a personal side project...</section>

			<li>Domain Modelling vs Technical Implementation</li>
			<li>Small Increments vs Large Refactors</li>
		</ul>

		<section>But I would also consider myself as an Agile developer...</section>
		<section>...I'm actually a Certified Scrum Master with Scrum Alliance thanks to my employers :)</section>
		<section>They're great by the way...</section>
		<section>...and the job's pretty awesome too</section>
		<section>I'm part of the product development team</section>
		<section>Learning lots of new things and solving lots of problems</section>
		<section>So if you think that you've got a better position for me in your team...</section>
		<section>...They've raised the bar pretty high :)</section>
		<section>But if you've got an interesting problem to be solved...</section>
